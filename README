Overview
--------------

PyGTD is  a simple  Getting Things  Done (GTD) system  based on  David Allen's
personal-productivity  book  and  Stephen  Covey's  'Seven  Habits  of  Highly
Effective People'. It is implemented as Python script written by Keith Martin
(http://96db.com/pyGTD/). The goal is to easily organize and prioritize your
todo lists.

vimGTD is the Vim frontend to the Python program and includes such features as
syntax highlighting, file navigation support, and a quick help reference.
