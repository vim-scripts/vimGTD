vimGTD - Using 'Getting Things Done' in Vim

Overview
--------

PyGTD is  a simple  Getting Things  Done (GTD) system  based on  David Allen's
personal-productivity  book  and  Stephen  Covey's  'Seven  Habits  of  Highly
Effective People'. It is implemented as Python script written by Keith Martin.
The goal is to easily organize and prioritize your todo lists.

vimGTD  is a  bundle  of  plugin files  which  integrates  PyGTD into  vim. For
convenience, I have also included the (slightly adapted) Python script and HTML
documentation in this distribution.

For a  detailed description  of the  PyGTD program, please  refer to  the HTML
documentation included or the  author's website: http://96db.com/pyGTD/.  Note
that if you update  the Python script from this site, you  will need to change
the default file extension from .txt to .gtd in the program code.


Installation
------------

Installation is fairly easy. Follow these steps:

(i)   Copy the contents of the directory 'vim' (with all subdirectories as is)
      to your local runtimepath (see ':help runtimepath' for various platforms).

(ii)  After all the vim plugin files are copied, execute ':helptags ~/.vim/doc'
      or your OS's equivalent to generate the new help tags.

(iii) Rename the 'gtd.py' Python script (in directory PyGTD) to 'gtd' and copy
      it to your system's execution path (on UNIX e.g. /usr/bin/gtd or
      /usr/local/bin/gtd).

(iv)  You might want to define a shorthand for running GTD from within vim
      (typically when you edit the todo.gtd file). The following mapping will
      do:

      map ,gtd :!gtd %<C-M>:e<C-M><C-M>

      so that ',gtd' launches PyGTD.

(v)   If you use vim in combination with the Mutt email client, try out
      the following macro in your muttrc configuration:

      macro index \ch "!vim ~/GTD/todo.gtd\n" "start GTD"
      macro pager \ch "!vim ~/GTD/todo.gtd\n" "start GTD"

      which binds <CTRL>h to vim opening todo.gtd in your $HOME/GTD directory
      using PyGTD (you might want to change the directory name).

(vi)  Note that double-clicking on the context filenames (filenames surrounded
      by brackets in the todo.gtd file) will automatically open them in a new
      vim buffer for editing.

(vii) Have fun using PyGTD with vim!
